### Exposed variables

`tidy` variable constains cleared and tidy data set computed from the downloaded files. all the details about content and computation of that dataset are available in [README.md](README.md)

To avoid global namespace pollution script uses IIFE so no other variables are exposed.

### Features

Most of the features are specified by the fiel `features_info.txt` and `features.txt` provided with the original data. Most of the following data is a copy from that file

#### New features

subject - id of the subject
activity - type of activity: a factor

#### Measurements

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc.XYZ and tGyro.XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc.XYZ and tGravityAcc.XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk.XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk.XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc.XYZ, fBodyAccJerk.XYZ, fBodyGyro.XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'.XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAcc.XYZ
tGravityAcc.XYZ
tBodyAccJerk.XYZ
tBodyGyro.XYZ

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean: Mean value
std: Standard deviation
